How to use Github + Android Studio

To import project:
Make sure you are logged in to your github account on your Android Studio + you have accepted the collaborator invite
Then go to the github repository, and click the green download/import button but do not click download as zip, but just copy the link that it shows.
Go back to android studio, and "important into version control", there you should be able to paste a link and paste the github repository link. It will create a path file on your computer, so make sure to delete any files that have the same path file if it is invalid
You click clone project and you just imported it successfully
Export:
I assume you have made your changes to the SDK file we imported, so first you wanna click VCS -> Commit (make sure all the boxes at the top of the commit screen are selected). Its gonna ask for a commit message, so just type in what you worked on.. This is to kind of save your changes on your own computer.
I recommend double checking that you are logged in to your own github + made a collaborater on the project
After that, go to VCS -> Git -> Push and make sure all files are still selected on the right hand portion of the pop-up screen. After you checked, click Push.
You should see a success message and your done
Tips:
Make sure to always update your project by going to VCS -> Update as people will most likely be making changes to the repository so you want to be on the same page as them
